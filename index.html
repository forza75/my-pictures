   			   <p>It was during february 2019. The guards changing in front of Prague's castle which one have a first view from St Charles bridge was very impressing.  </p>

   			   <p>This trip was one of the most wonderful trip I have the chance to live. In fact, it was in summer 2019 and I did so many things that I can even not tell all of them here. During this journey I have learnt many things about different cultures, how life is in this country. I have met new nice persons with whom I have played volley ball. I have gone into the jungle, sharing my lunch with monkeys or orangutans. I have also visited with an association which is called <a href="https://authenticsumatra.com/" target="_blank">Authentic Sumatra</a>. I have also played and gone surfing with young children in a orphanage, saved eggs turtles from birds. For glance : I have eaten fried rice during three weeks and lost 10 pounds ! </p>

   			   <img src="images/Cambodia.jpg" alt="Cambodia ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡­">
   			   <p>I was in Cambodia during october 2019. It was really impressive to see one of the most beautiful monument in the world : the Temples of Angkor. I have met young children and played football with them in their schoolyard. It is a really poor land where young children come to you to have food, money... </p>

   			   <img src="images/Thailand Sea.jpg" alt="Thailand Sea">
   			   <p>My trip in Thailand was incredible. The weather during october, the people I met, the different places where I was and the activities I have practiced such as visiting Buddhist temples, snorkeling or cooking (spring rolls) were just amazing! A lot of wonderful landscapes and an island, Koh Chang, which is just the paradise. </p>
